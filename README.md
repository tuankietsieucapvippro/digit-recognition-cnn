# Digit Recognition with CNN 🧠🔢

## Project Overview

### 1 🎯 Goal
The goal of this project is to build a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to recognize handwritten digits (0–9) from grayscale images.  
The model is trained on a public dataset (from Kaggle), and it can predict the digit in a new image input.

This is a basic deep learning project for computer vision, classification, and model deployment practice.
