# Digit Recognition with CNN 🧠🔢

## Project Overview

### 1 🎯 Goal
This project aims to build a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to recognize handwritten digits from `0` to `9`.  
The model is trained on a custom dataset in `.csv` format that contains grayscale images of digits, each 28x28 pixels.

After training, the model can accurately predict the digit from a new input image.

### 2 📦 Dependencies
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow` (with Keras)
- `gdown` (used to download dataset from Google Drive)
